# Improving Tropical Cyclone Track Forecast

## Overview
Over the period from 2008 to 2022, the United States experienced a range of tropical cyclones, including hurricanes and tropical storms. The ability to predict the track of tropical cyclones is important for public safety and disaster preparedness, reducing the risk to human life and property. The Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) is a sophisticated physics model created by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to make weather predictions spanning from days to weeks into the future. However, the GEFS Mean can have relatively large biases that can lead to large predicted track error. In order to correct the GEFS Mean 5-day forecasts for tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Basin, this research will develop a CNN model developed by taking into account data from 2,395 tropical cyclone 5-day forecast sequences across the United States in a 15 year timespan. 

## Data Sources
The 21 GEFS ensemble members were obtained every 6 hours out to day 5 forecast predictions from 2008-2022. The tropical cyclone Best Tracks and GEFS tropical cyclone storm forecast tracks were retrieved from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) National Hurricane Center. Python version 3.9.13 on Jupyter Notebooks, a Python development environment, was used to develop Python code for this project.

## Methodology
### Processing: 
When gathering the GEFS data, some tropical cyclone ensemble member forecasts may be missing. Thus, when preliminarily screening the data, the missing tropical cyclone data was deleted. In addition, the short tropical cyclone sequences with a lifespan of less than 5 days were deleted to avoid affecting the accuracy. Therefore, of the total 263 tropical cyclone storms from 2008-2022 gathered, 139 tropical cyclones were included in this research.

### Modeling: 
The Python torch library was used to create the CNN model. The input to the modeling process was the data frame resulting from the data processing of the multiple tropical cyclone storms. To ensure randomness of tropical cyclone sequences inputted to the AI Model, the order of tropical cyclone sequences data within the data frame was shuffled using a constant seed. K-fold cross-validation was used to determine a more reliable accuracy score using a k-value of 10. 

### Evaluation: 
To assess the accuracy of the AI Model in comparison to the GEFS Mean, a crucial step involved employing the haversine function for distance calculations. The haversine function was used to calculate the distances in kilometers between the predicted latitude and longitude coordinates of both the AI Model and GEFS Mean, and the corresponding Best Track latitude and longitude coordinates for each forecast lead time. The Relative Improvement Percentage is a valuable metric for assessing the enhancement achieved by the AI Model over the GEFS Mean. By calculating the percentage improvement, one can quantitatively measure the extent to which the AI Model has refined its predictive capabilities. A positive Relative Improvement Percentage signifies a reduction in the root mean squared error (RMSE), indicating that the AI Model has produced predictions closer to the Best Track compared to the GEFS Mean.

### Overall Statistics: 
Based on graphing the average total track error as a function of forecast lead times for the GEFS Mean and AI Model with 95% confidence intervals, the AI Model generally outperforms the GEFS Mean, especially between 0 and 72 hours in advance. Based on graphing the distribution of total track error as a function of forecast lead time for the GEFS Mean and AI Model, the AI Model displays lower standard deviation values across all forecast lead times. This suggests a more consistent performance in its predictions. Additionally, the AI Model demonstrates smaller errors in certain instances, as reflected in the lower minimum values. Extreme errors are also comparatively subdued, with lower maximum values. On the other hand, the GEFS Mean showcases higher variability, larger standard deviation values, and the potential for more substantial errors. The higher maximum values indicate the likelihood of larger errors, particularly in extreme cases. Overall, the AI Model offers a more reliable and accurate prediction performance compared to the GEFS Mean.
